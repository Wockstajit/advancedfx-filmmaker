// FilmmakerDemoInfo - parse a CS2 .dem and print a JSON scoreboard summary.
//
// Usage:  FilmmakerDemoInfo <path-to-demo.dem> [accountId,accountId,...]
// Output: a single JSON object on stdout (see result below). On failure it still
//         prints JSON {"ok":false,"error":"..."} and returns non-zero so the C++
//         caller can cache the negative result and not retry forever.
//
// Stats are read straight off the CCSPlayerController each command (real CS2
// Score / MVPs / MatchStats), and the roster is accumulated DURING the parse -
// reading demo.Players only at the end misses everyone who disconnected in a GOTV
// demo's post-match wind-down (which is why only 2 players showed before).
//
// NAMES-FAST MODE: when the caller passes a comma-separated list of Steam account
// ids (it already has the full scoreboard from the .dem.info matchmaking sidecar
// and only needs player NAMES), the parse is cancelled the instant every wanted
// account id has a name. Names appear in the first second of a demo, so this turns
// a multi-second full decode into a sub-second one. In that mode duration/score
// are left at 0 because they would be truncated - the caller takes those from the
// sidecar / .dem header instead.
