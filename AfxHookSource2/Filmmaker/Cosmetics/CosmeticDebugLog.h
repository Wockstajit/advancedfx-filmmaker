// Self-service debug logger for SOURCE:MVM. The implementation remains in the Cosmetics folder for
// source compatibility with the original cosmetics-only logger, but the log now covers the complete
// filmmaker command/UI surface, console output, camera state, and cosmetics runtime events.
//
// Console: `mvm_debug start` / `mvm_debug stop|status` (short alias) OR
//          `mirv_filmmaker cosmetics debuglog start|stop|status`.
// Identical events are written once per session. A repeat summary records the count and first/last
// occurrence instead of writing one line per frame, even when different events occur in between.
// Logs are written to %APPDATA%\HLAE\debuglogs\mvm_debug_<YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS>.log.
